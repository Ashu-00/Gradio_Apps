# Gradio App for Summarization of arXiv Papers

Local App for summarization of arXiv papers from Code and names.


### Important
- Add your groq api key in main.py .
- Make a [virtual environment](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/) for running.

### Usage
- Run the virtual environment.
- Run main.py .
- Add paper name/code in the chat to get summarized results.

### Current Limitations
- Simple Interface
- Can be difficult to find papers sometimes (Issue on side of arXiv api)
- Slow output due to groq limitations.
